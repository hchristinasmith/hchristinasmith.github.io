      <h2>Problem Solving Reflection</h2>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>1. Blocked on a Simple Problem</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong> Syntax Error</p>
        <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> Google, looking back in notes, reading the code carefully for misspellings or syntax errors. If a lot of time had gone by, I'd walk away from the computer and come back.</p>
        <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> Uncomfortable, a little frustrated if I had spent a bit of time on it. Stoked when I figured it out.</p>
        <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong> To read my code carefully to recognise any spelling mistakes/errors.</p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary><strong>2. Elegantly Solved a Problem</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What was the problem?</strong> A problem on JS Kata.</p>
        <p><strong>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</strong> Google, looking back in notes, writing out the problem in simple English and trying to translate it into JavaScript. Read syntax carefully.</p>
        <p><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong> Mostly confused and frustrated, don't think I have elegantly solved a problem yet! But once I got the answer, I felt good.</p>
        <p><strong>What did you learn?</strong> I should learn to understand how to use <code>console.log</code> more.</p>
      </details>

        <summary><strong>3. Reflection on Problem-Solving Techniques</strong></summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> Good - helps me plan before diving into code.</li>
          <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> Good</li>
          <li><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> Good - I like to write out the problem in English then try to translate it.</li>
          <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> Getting better - messages are still cryptic, but it helps me trace bugs instead of randomly guessing.</li>
          <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> Not confident - unsure what to <code>console.log</code>, where to place the logs, or how to interpret what I see. I want to get more comfortable using it. Need more practice.</li>
          <li><strong>Googling:</strong> Good - often my go-to.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking peers for help:</strong> Haven't done this so much. I think I will more moving into bootcamp and getting to know people better.</li>
          <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> I hesitate - trying to balance being resourceful with knowing when to reach out. I feel more confident when I've already tried a few things.</li>
          <li><strong>Improving process with reflection:</strong> Helpful - it helps me recognise patterns, and celebrate progress. I want to keep making time for it, even just a few minutes after a challenge as it strengthens my learning.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary><strong>4. Reflection on Asking for Help</strong></summary>
        <p>This happens quite often. Just about every question in the JavaScript Kata I was wanting to ask for help. I didn't want to seem incapable or like I hadn't tried enough. I worried that the question might be “too basic” or that I hadn't earned the right to ask yet. There was also a part of me that felt like asking for help would take away from the satisfaction of figuring it out on my own.</p>
        <p>Next time, I want to catch the moment when frustration turns into unproductive looping and use it as a sign to pause and ask. Before reaching out, I can jot down what I've tried so far, what I think the issue is, and what I don't understand. This way, I'm not hustling for an answer, but inviting a conversation that can help me learn. I also want to remind myself that asking for help doesn't make me any less capable.</p>
