    <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
  
    <h2>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h2>
    <p>
      Freelancing/owning my own business.
    </p>
  
    <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
    <p>
      My strengths include curiosity and a love of learning, particularly when it comes to areas I’m passionate about. 
      I’m good at thinking creatively and looking for solutions outside the box. However, one limitation is my attention span. 
      I sometimes struggle to stay focused on tasks for long periods, especially when learning something new or complex. 
      I’ve been working on improving this by practicing mindfulness and breaking tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
    </p>
  
    <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p>
      I’d like to become more confident and assertive in my ideas while being kind and supportive of others. 
      Additionally, I want to develop a stronger ability to manage stress and maintain a healthy work-life balance.
    </p>
  
    <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme</h2>
    <p>
      To manage my workload, I plan to break tasks into manageable chunks and prioritise them based on deadlines and importance. 
      I will also set aside time each day to focus on my learning and ensure I don’t get overwhelmed by other commitments. 
      When things start building up, I will take breaks to reset and do something else, like going for a walk or doing house chores, to clear my head. 
      If I feel stuck or overwhelmed, I’ll seek help promptly from my peers, facilitators, or industry/community representatives. 
      I understand the importance of asking for help when needed and plan to use the available resources to stay on track.
    </p>
  
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
    <p>
      I will seek help from my peers, facilitators, or industry/community representatives whenever I encounter challenges that hinder my progress. 
      I will be proactive in asking for assistance and use the available resources to ensure that I stay on track.
    </p>
  
    <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
    <p>
      From the facilitation team, I expect support, guidance, and constructive feedback. I’d like the team to be approachable and available 
      when I need help, especially when I encounter challenges with learning or project work. Clear communication and regular check-ins will 
      also be important to keep me motivated and ensure that I’m on the right track.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h2>
    <p>
      I’ll need to schedule time for my other commitments, such as personal projects, gym, and work. I plan to block out time for these activities 
      to ensure they don’t conflict with my learning. I’ll also make sure to communicate with my team if any scheduling issues arise.
