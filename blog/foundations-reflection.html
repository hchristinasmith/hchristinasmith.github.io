          <summary><strong>1. Three New Things I've Learned About Myself and My Ego</strong></summary>
          <p><strong>What have you learned about your ego and reactions to challenges?</strong></p>
          <p>My ego reacts strongly to errors. I feel frustrated and embarrassed when my code doesn’t work. But I’m learning to see mistakes as normal and valuable. Each bug is an opportunity to grow, not a reflection of my intelligence.</p>
          <p>I hesitate to ask for help. My ego wants to appear capable and independent, so I sometimes struggle alone instead of reaching out. I’m beginning to accept that asking questions shows strength, not weakness. It helps me learn faster and connect better with others.</p>
          <p>I realise I value speed over persistence. I tend to judge myself when I don’t understand something right away. My ego wants quick success. Steady effort, patience, and problem-solving matter more than instant results. I’m learning to embrace the process instead of chasing perfection.</p>

          <summary><strong>2. The Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness in Learning and Programming</strong></summary>
          <p><strong>What role do these concepts play in learning and programming?</strong></p>
          <p>Values guide my motivation and commitment. Aligning my learning with what I care about makes me feel more driven and focused. Empathy helps me consider the needs and perspectives of users, teammates, and future developers reading my code. Self-awareness keeps my ego in check and helps me grow. It allows me to notice when I’m stuck in frustration, avoiding help, or comparing myself to others. When I stay aware of my thoughts and emotional patterns, I can respond more constructively, reflect on my progress, and learn more deeply.</p>

          <summary><strong>3. What Has Surprised Me the Most About the Human Skills Learning?</strong></summary>
          <p><strong>What surprised you about Human Skills learning?</strong></p>
          <p>What has surprised me the most is how much I’ve learned about myself—particularly my learning style and ego. I used to think learning was just about absorbing information, but now I realize it’s also about understanding how I learn best—what motivates me, how I respond to challenges, and what conditions help me focus and grow.</p>
          <p>I was also surprised to discover how much my ego influences my reactions. Whether it’s getting defensive when I don’t understand something right away or hesitating to ask for help because I don’t want to seem incompetent, these patterns became clearer through Human Skills. Becoming aware of them is helping me become a more open, resilient, and collaborative learner.</p>

          <summary><strong>4. The Most Challenging Aspects of the Human Skills Learning</strong></summary>
          <p><strong>What was most challenging about this learning process?</strong></p>
          <p>The most challenging aspect was learning how to truly listen to others without jumping to conclusions or thinking of a response. Practising empathy, patience, and active listening required me to slow down and be more present—skills that don’t come naturally when I’m used to focusing on tasks and outcomes.</p>

          <summary><strong>5. Why Human Skills Are Important in a Programming Bootcamp</strong></summary>
          <p><strong>Why are we spending so much time focusing on Human Skills in a web development Bootcamp?</strong></p>
          <p>Technical skills alone aren’t enough to succeed in the real world of web development. Writing code is only part of the job—being able to collaborate with others, communicate ideas clearly, handle feedback, manage frustration, and stay adaptable under pressure is just as important, especially in fast-paced tech environments.</p>

          <summary><strong>6. Does Time Spent on Human Skills Feel Like a Waste?</strong></summary>
          <p><strong>Should you have spent that time practising programming instead?</strong></p>
          <p>Definitely not a waste of time. Introspection and working with people is so valuable to learn how to do. Learning how to reflect, communicate, collaborate, and manage my mindset has helped me grow not just as a programmer, but as a person. Especially now when AI can do lots of the technical work, being able to work well in a team, handle feedback, stay resilient through challenges, and build software with a real-world impact requires strong human skills.</p>
