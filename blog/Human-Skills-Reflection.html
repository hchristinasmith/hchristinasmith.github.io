        <summary><strong>1. Long-Term Goal and Career Pathway</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong> Ideally, I'd like to work as a freelancer. I'm not completely clear on the details yet, but I know I want to work for myself while still being around people in some way. I'm hoping the skills I gain during this course will give me the confidence and ability to do that. I want to use what I learn here to create a lifestyle where I can do meaningful work, contribute value, and feel free and connected at the same time.</p>

        <summary><strong>2. Strengths and Limitations in Bootcamp</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong> My biggest strength will be knowing when to take a break and how to care for myself mentally—making sure I'm going to the gym, sleeping and eating well, and keeping myself balanced. My biggest limitation will probably be following through consistently with those self-care practices when I'm under pressure. I also need to be mindful of asking for help only after I've tried to work things out myself, but without waiting so long that I get frustrated. Compassion and self-awareness will be key for me here.</p>

        <summary><strong>3. Non-Technical Challenges</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong> Interacting with people through a screen. It's just different, and I do find it hard sometimes to feel connected or fully engaged online.</p>
      </details>
    
      <details>
        <summary><strong>4. Human Skills to Develop</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What non-technical skills would you like to develop?</strong> I want to improve my communication—specifically being open and clear, especially when I need to advocate for myself or share ideas. I want to be able to do that while staying true to my values of kindness and compassion. I also want to get better at self-reflection and tracking my emotional responses during challenges. I'd like to integrate feedback without taking it personally, and practice giving honest, constructive feedback in return. Focus is another thing I'm working on—sometimes I drift, especially when I'm overwhelmed. I want to stay grounded, especially in group work or under pressure.</p>
      </details>
    
      <details>
        <summary><strong>5. Expectations of the Bootcamp Team</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong> Support, to me, looks like a non-judgemental space where I feel safe asking questions. It looks like compassionate feedback that encourages growth without making me feel small. I want to be encouraged to push myself, but also have space to recalibrate when needed. I'd really value someone pointing me in the right direction when I'm stuck—technically or emotionally—and time to reflect when things get tough.</p>
      </details>
    
      <details>
        <summary><strong>6. Expectations of Yourself</strong></summary>
        <p><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</strong> I'll make sure I take breaks away from the screen, spend time outside, and stay social. I'll ask for help earlier than I did in Foundations so I don't get stuck in frustration. I'll keep reflecting on my learning style and update my approach as I go. I'll make sure I actually understand the content, take notes, research, and apply it—especially by diving into concepts I don't know straight away. I'll use my whiteboard to make daily to-do lists and study plans. I want to give my all to the projects and really get the most out of Bootcamp, while still maintaining balance to avoid burnout. I'm aware of how screen time affects me, so I'll need to stay on top of managing that carefully.</p>
