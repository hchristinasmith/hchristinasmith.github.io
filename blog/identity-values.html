    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>

    <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>

      <p>I was at work, and we were in a group, with the CEO of the company trying to figure out new R&D pathways. One of the other interns took credit for one of my ideas. I valued harmony of the team or relationship, and instead of speaking up, I chose to keep quet to avoid political conflict. I weighed up integrity, the importance of being recognised for my contributions and ensuring fairness. And Harmony, perserving the team dynamic and not rocking the boat. Confronting the situation could have created discomfort, but staying silent felt like a compromise on my integrity. 

  I chose to stay quiet in the moment, beasue i didnt want to cause fritction or complicate the situation. 
  
  Next time, I might find a way to address similar issues with more confidence, perhaps in a way that balacens integrity and harmony more effectively. It might also help me consider how to approach situations like this in the future, knowing that finding a fair and respectful way to speak up is important - both for my own sense of integrity and for the strength of my relationships.</p>


  <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>

    <p>I grew up in a family that valued hard work and education, striving for achievement and having a career that I feel fulfilled and happy in. </p>

  <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h2>

<p>After taking the Via Character strengths test, I found my strengths are Sprirtuality, Love of Learning, Hope, and Kindness. 

Sprituality may give me a sense of purpose and direction, helping me to stay grounded when challenges arise. It may provide me with a deep connection to my goals, which may insprie persernace and resilience. In moments of self doubt or fustration, my sprituality may keep me moving forward.

A love of learning my fuel curiosity and excitement. It may help me approach new conecpts with enthusiasm and determination. My curiosity may encourage me to seek out new knowledge and explore different persectives, enriching my learning experience.
</p>

<h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>

<p>My attention span, I've realised needs alot of work. So staying focused on a task for a good amount of time is going to be a challenge. I also feel discomfort when learning a new concept, but in a good way (like growing pains) Which may lead to self-doubt or a desire to avoid challenging material, which might hinder my progress in areas where you need to grow the most. I need to keep reminding myself that I am learning and it's ok to not understand something right away. </p>

<h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>

<p>While working in the lab, I asked a student who was helping me to take on a task that would allow me to be more productive and efficient. She declined, and I walked away feeling uneasy. Later, I apologised, thinking I may have been too pushy or controlling. Upon reflection, I realize I should have recognised the value of the work I was putting in and remained more confident in my leadership. I should have kindly but firmly communicated the importance of the task, as I was leading the work and it was essential for the task to be completed well and efficiently.

<h2>Why I'm Attending Dev Academy</h2>

  I'm attending Dev Academy for a challenge and to hopefully open up more doors in my career.
